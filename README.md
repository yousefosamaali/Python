# Introduction
This project aims to analyze and visualize stock data for Tesla (TSLA) and GameStop (GME) using Python. It leverages the yfinance library to extract stock data and web scraping techniques to gather revenue data from relevant sources.

# Define a Function that Makes a Graph
A function is defined in the code to create graphs for visualizing stock price trends. This function takes stock data as input and generates plots for easier analysis.

# Question 1: Use yfinance to Extract Stock Data
In this section, we utilize the yfinance library to extract historical stock data for Tesla and GameStop. The data includes stock prices, trading volume, and other relevant information.

# Question 2: Use Webscraping to Extract Tesla Revenue Data
Web scraping is performed to retrieve Tesla's revenue data from a designated website. This section outlines the steps taken to extract, clean, and organize the data.

# Question 3: Use yfinance to Extract Stock Data
Similar to Question 1, this part of the project uses the yfinance library to extract additional stock data, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the stocks analyzed.

# Question 4: Use Webscraping to Extract GME Revenue Data
Web scraping techniques are again applied to gather revenue data for GameStop. The focus is on extracting relevant financial metrics and presenting them clearly.

# Question 5: Plot Tesla Stock Graph
Using the extracted data, a graph is plotted to visualize Tesla's stock performance over a specified time period. This section highlights trends and key observations.

# Question 6: Plot GameStop Stock Graph
Similarly, a graph is created to visualize GameStop's stock performance. The analysis includes significant price movements and trading patterns.
